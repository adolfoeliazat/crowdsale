Crowdsale
===

**this is the repository for the crowdsale application**.

###Build Information

- Travis: [![Travis]](https://travis-ci.org/FundRequest/crowdsale.svg?branch=master)
- Sputnik: [![Sputnik]](https://sputnik.ci/app#/builds/FundRequest/crowdsale)

###Architecture

Spring boot will be used as a self-serving web application with the sole purpose of providing a stable environment in a high-available environment.

###Your privacy is respected
We'll make this entire application public to provide proof that we won't keep track of any more data other than what already is public. You can audit this repository at any time.

###Security Audits
Next to our own security audits, we urge the community to also perform one on this and all repositories, especially the [contract repository](https://github.com/fundrequest/contracts).
